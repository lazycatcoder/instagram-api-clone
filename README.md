  <h1>Instagram API clone</h1>
</div>

<div align="justify">

   This project is an API application developed as a clone of the popular social platform Instagram. It provides a range of functionality that allows users to interact with posts, users, and comments. The application is developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **JWT** *(JSON Web Tokens)*, etc.

   üìù Here is an overview of the main features and principles of the application:

   1. Authentication and authorization:  
      *‚Ä¢ Users can register by creating accounts with unique identifiers  
      ‚Ä¢ Registered users can log in using their credentials  
      ‚Ä¢ Upon successful authentication, users receive an access token that is used to authorize requests*  

   2. Users:  
      *‚Ä¢ Only public information about Users is available for viewing  
      ‚Ä¢ Users can edit their account information as well as delete their account  
      ‚Ä¢ Each user has a unique ID, username, email address and password*  
   
   3. Posts:  
      *‚Ä¢ Users can create new posts including images and descriptions  
      ‚Ä¢ Each post is associated with a specific user and contains a unique ID, image, description, and creation date  
      ‚Ä¢ Users can only edit or delete their own posts  
      ‚Ä¢ Users can view publications, both their own and other users publications*  

   4. Comments:  
      *‚Ä¢ Users can add comments to posts  
      ‚Ä¢ Each comment is associated with a specific post and the user who wrote it  
      ‚Ä¢ Users can only edit or delete their own comments  
      ‚Ä¢ Users can view comments on posts and reply to them* 

   5. Pagination:  
      *‚Ä¢ Lists of Users, Posts, and Comments are paginated for easy navigation and query efficiency  
      ‚Ä¢ Users can receive data in chunks by specifying the page number or data chunk size in the request*  

   6. Uploading images:  
      *‚Ä¢ Users can upload images to their publications  
      ‚Ä¢ Uploaded images are stored on the server and linked to the respective publication  
      ‚Ä¢ For the uploaded image, a link is formed by which it will be available*  

   7. Route protection:  
      *‚Ä¢ Some routes require authentication and authorization to restrict access to registered users only  
      ‚Ä¢ Middleware functions are used to validate the access token and allow or deny access*  

   8. Error Handling:  
      *‚Ä¢ In case of errors such as invalid route, server error, or insufficient authorization, the API returns appropriate error messages with appropriate statuses*

1. Clone this repository

```
   git clone https://github.com/lazycatcoder/instagram-api-clone.git
```


2. Install **Node.js**
   
**Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: *https://nodejs.org*

3. Install **MongoDB** 

- Install **MongoDB Compass** from official website: *https://www.mongodb.com/*  
- After installation **MongoDB Compass** create the **mydatabase** database on *localhost:27017*.  
- In the **mydatabase** create 3 collections: *Users*, *Posts*, *Comments*.  
- For each collection, import test data from the corresponding JSON files in the ***'instagram-api-clone\test_data'*** folder.

4. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the extracted/cloned repository folder. Run the following command to install the required dependencies listed in the **package.json** file:

```
   npm install
```

5. Start the Server üöÄ

In the same terminal or command prompt, navigate to the repository folder.
Run the following command to start the server:

```
   nodemon app.js
```
The server should now be running and listening for requests on the specified port *(default is port 3000)*.

6. Application testing

Download Postman from *https://www.postman.com/* if you don't have it installed.  

‚ö°Launch Postman and check the following application routes:

## üîπAuthentication and Registration 

| Route            |  HTTP  | AUTH body (raw JSON)                                         | Auth | Description  |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------ |
| /api/auth/signup | `POST` | { "username": "username4", "email": "example4@example.com", "password": "password4", "confirmPassword": "password4" } |  -  |  Signup |
| /api/auth/login  | `POST` | { "email": "example1@example.com", "password": "password1" } |  -   | Login        |
| /api/auth/logout | `POST` | { "_id": "64aab44e21b75abc2d297eb3" }                        |  +   | Logout       |

<br>

üö© *using the test file **mydatabase.users.json** you can also login as a different user.* 
- user 1:
```
   { "email": "example1@example.com", "password": "password1" }
```
- user 2:
```
   { "email": "example2@example.com", "password": "password2" }
```
- user 3:
```
   { "email": "example3@example.com", "password": "password3" }
```
<br>

<div align="justify">

‚ö†Ô∏è *when you test this API in **Postman**, for requests where Authentication is required ("+"), in the "Authorization" (or "Headers") section, you must add the Token that was generated when the User logged into the system.*
